### Setup ###

1. Open receive-cue.html on the receiving device.
2. Open send-cue.html on the sending device.
3. Both should indicate in the *Status* box that they have been connected.



Should either username indicate that it has already been taken, wait a day for the hold to expire on the server, or manually change the id in BOTH send-cue.html and receive-cue.html.
